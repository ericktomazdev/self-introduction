<h1>What am I capable of?</h1>
<p>I believe that transparency is the top main characteristic that someone can have. 
Starting from this point, I point out what are my main skills in programming, <strong><i>no more no less</i></strong>.
</p>

<h3>1. Dart FUNCTIONAL main/core programming skills</h3>
<p> 
  How to make use of <strong><i>OOP</i></strong> and take advantage of it as well as a
  plain understanding of <strong><i>data manipulation</i></strong>, utilizing higher-order
  functions to group and manipulate data. Advanced understanding of clean-logical functions
  with closures. Plain use of control-flow algorithm, such as 
  <strong><i>switch's</i></strong>, <strong><i>if-else's</i></strong> and <strong><i>for loop</i></strong>
  statements. Use of collections such as <strong><i>Lists, Maps</i></strong> and <strong><i>Sets</i></strong>. Key comprehension of <strong><i>Dart Null Safety</i></strong>.
</p>

<h3>2. Flutter Widgets</h3>
<p> 
   Creation and implementation of complex-nested <strong><i>Stateless</i></strong> & <strong><i>Stateful</i></strong> widgets.
   Key understanding of layout and use of self-adjusting size components utilizing <strong><i>Media Queries</i></strong>.
   Handling large datasets with <strong><i>list builders</i></strong> and working with <strong><i>buttons</i></strong> and 
   <strong><i>text fields</i></strong>, as well as presenting <strong><i>bottom sheets</i></strong> and <strong><i>dialogs</i></strong>,
   always considering <strong><i>code legibility</i></strong>.
</p>

<h3>3. State Management</h3>
<p>
   Understanding of MV* architecture, such as <strong><i>Model View Controller</i></strong>. Making use of <strong><i>InheritedWidget</i></strong> and advanced state management with streams: 
    <ul>

      <li>Subscribing to streams events</li>
      <li>Multiple streams subscriptions</li>
      <li>Implementing StreamBuilder</li>
    </ul>
    Implementation of <strong><i>BLoC pattern</i></strong>. 
</p>

<h3>4. Asynchronous programming</h3>
<p>
  Using multiple Futures at the same time and implementing <strong><i>Future Builder</i></strong> to manage Futures. Use of Futures to turn navigation routes into asynchronous     functions. Understanding of common patterns to solve issues in async programming. 
</p>

<h3>5. Data persisentece and Communication with the internet</h3>
<p>
    Plain understand of <strong><i>POST, PUT</i></strong> and <strong><i>DELETE</i></strong>-ing data.
